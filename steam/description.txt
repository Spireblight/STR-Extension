This is a mod necessary to run when using Twitch extension [b][url=https://dashboard.twitch.tv/extensions/7dgfio8rek8dhju8628riism3fd11p-1.1.0]Slay the Relics[/url][/b]. It doesn't change anything about your game, all it does is take some of your game data and sends it over to Twitch. See the extension's config on Twitch for straightforward setup instructions.

Slay the Relics extension: https://dashboard.twitch.tv/extensions/7dgfio8rek8dhju8628riism3fd11p-1.1.0

Lower the barrier to your stream for new and intermediate StS players! The extension let's your viewers [b]see your deck and potential upgrades, display descriptions of relics, potions, player powers, monster powers and orbs on stream[/b] when [i]They[/i] want. All they need to do is click the deck button or hover over particular item as if they were playing themselves. The UI was pedantically crafted such that it looks just like the game, your viewers will probably forget most of the time that it's a Twitch extension.

Your viewers no longer need to know everything in the game by heart and your chat can be freed for actual relevant discussion and memes.
