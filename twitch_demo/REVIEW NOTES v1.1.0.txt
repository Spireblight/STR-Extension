This is an extension that tries to bring part of the experience of Slay the Spire to the viewer. It imitates part of the GUI of the game on stream.  It displays descriptions of various items the player owns and also of player and monster powers in combat. The data only flows one way for the viewer (from the game to the extension), they receive the data from the game and that is displayed on stream. All they have to do is to hover over various areas exactly as if they were playing the game themselves. The extension provides no further interaction for the viewer, all they can do is display info about the state of the game of the streamer, they do not have any ability to interact with the streamer or the game through the extension.

The data is being extracted using a mod of Slay the Spire and through my EBS sent to the extension using PubSub messaging.

Version History/Changelog:

version 1.0.0 - currently released
 - displays only relic descriptions (relics are items that are acquired during a playthrough, appear right below the top panel)
 - I accidentally whitelisted a streamer I tested with

version 1.0.1
 - same as 1.0.0 except the streamer was removed from the whitelist - thus this is a public version
 - this version was stuck in review process for 6 weeks, my testing channel was accidentally not live during review and the extension was put into a Pending Action status. I did not know that to resolve this I had to resubmit the extension for review, so I just responded that I'm live from now on and waited. In the end, instead of going through with the review of this version, I decided to directly move on to the next version as it was already finished by the point I found out where I made the mistake.

version 1.1.0
 - in addition to relic descriptions, displays descriptions of potions, player powers, monster powers, player orbs (special mechanic on one of the characters, can be seen on the testing stream) when the viewer hovers over them
 - on the testing stream, you can see the areas of interest highlighted, those are all that are sensitive to mouse hover and display the descriptions as described here.
 - some of the descriptions track and follow mouse movement over their respective hitboxes, some don't. This is intended and mimics the behavior in the game.

I hope I provided a clear overview and guide on what my extension does and how to test it. If you find it incomplete please tell me what you're missing and next time I'll make sure to include it. Thank you!
